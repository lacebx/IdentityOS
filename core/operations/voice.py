"""
core/operations/voice.py

Aster's communication identity and outbound style enforcement — the shared
rendering/validation layer for every Aster-authored outbound boundary.

Two responsibilities:

1. Communication identity: who Aster is in external communication (name,
   display name, canonical email, principal, disclosure lines, full/compact/
   HTML signatures, writing profile). Mission-specific values live in
   :mod:`core.operations.aster`; this module holds the generic machinery.

2. The em-dash invariant: ASTER-AUTHORED OUTBOUND TEXT MUST CONTAIN ZERO
   U+2014 CHARACTERS. This is an identity-level rule, not a prompt
   preference. Enforcement is layered:

   - generation constraints (the writing profile instructs the model);
   - deterministic validation at every covered boundary;
   - deterministic repair for a narrow set of meaning-safe patterns
     (numeric ranges, paired parentheticals) — never a blind
     ``text.replace("—", "-")``, which produces poor writing;
   - rejection with regeneration when safe repair is impossible.

Historical records and quoted third-party evidence are never mutated: the
rule governs Aster-authored OUTPUT only.
