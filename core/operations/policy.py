Authority policy — the hard boundary between autonomous action and escalation.

The operator may act autonomously on low-risk, reversible communication.  It may
*never* autonomously commit the principal to anything consequential.  This module
turns that boundary into an inspectable decision so the engine can mark work as
``AWAITING_HUMAN_AUTHORIZATION`` instead of guessing.
