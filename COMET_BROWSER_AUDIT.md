# COMET BROWSER AUTOMATION AUDIT — POST-IMPLEMENTATION (Phases 1-6)

## Overall

**Comet browser automation parity: 84%**

This percentage is derived from the updated test matrix: 16/19 categories fully working, 2 partially working, 1 missing/not implemented.

---

## Fully Working (16/19)

| Capability | Evidence |
|------------|----------|
| **Basic Navigation** | `browser.open`, `browser.navigate`, `browser.snapshot`, `browser.status`, `browser.click` (text/selector), `browser.wait` all functional. 20-step workflow completed 20/20. |
| **DOM Understanding** | `browser.snapshot` returns URL, title, visible text (12k chars), and 80 interactive elements with role, name, type, href, selector hints. |
| **Clicking** | Click by CSS selector, visible text, role+name works. Verified on links, buttons, radio, checkboxes. |
| **Typing** | `browser.type` (with clear, press_enter) and `browser.fill` (clears first) work on text, email, tel, textarea inputs. |
| **Forms** | Multi-field fill, radio/checkbox selection, submit via click(text="Submit") all work. Validated on httpbin.org/forms/post. |
| **JavaScript Execution** | `browser.eval_js` executes arbitrary JS in page context, returns JSON. Tested: `document.title`, `window.location.href`, DOM queries. |
| **Dynamic Sites (SPA)** | JavaScript-rendered content (quotes.toscrape.com/js/) loads and is readable. Client-side navigation (Next → page/2/) works. |
| **Credential Brokering** | `secret-ref://` values accepted in `browser.login`; passwords redacted in results (`***`); raw secrets never in LLM context. |
| **Firefox Profile Reuse** | `browser.use_profile` imports cookies from locked Firefox profiles into Playwright Chromium. Verified GitHub auth via cookie import. |
| **Error Handling** | Nonexistent elements → timeout errors with call logs. Invalid URLs → `UnsafeBrowserURL` blocked. Recovery by navigation + retry works. |
| **Multi-step Workflows** | 20-action sequence (search→open→click→navigate→fill→submit→SPA nav) completed 100% success. |
| **Tabs/Windows** | `new_tab`, `switch_tab`, `close_tab`, `list_tabs` all work. `list_tabs` returns all tabs with URL, title, active status. Stress tested: 50 repeated calls, 0 failures. |
| **File Upload** | `browser.upload_file` with selector/role/name/text targeting, path validation (restricted to workspace/home/temp), multiple file support. Verified on the-internet.herokuapp.com/upload. |
| **File Download** | `browser.download` (click or URL-based with `page.expect_download`), `browser.list_downloads`. Downloads saved to identity-scoped `browser/downloads/` directory. Verified on httpbin.org/bytes/100. |
| **Screenshots** | `browser.screenshot` captures viewport, full_page, or element. Saved to identity-scoped `browser/screenshots/` directory. |
| **Visual Understanding** | `browser.analyze_screenshot` encodes screenshot as base64 with instruction for vision-capable model. Returns structured data ready for planner. Gracefully reports when no vision model configured. |

---

## Partially Working (2/19)

| Capability | Status | Why |
|------------|--------|-----|
| **Authentication/Session** | PARTIAL | `browser.login` works with explicit selectors; credential brokering works; but no MFA detection, no auto-login-form detection reliability. Session persistence now works via disk checkpoints + Firefox profile cookies. |
| **Evidence/Provenance** | PARTIAL | Each `CapabilityResult` includes timestamp, duration, params, data, error, source. But browser actions don't auto-record into Identity's `evidence()` / `provenance()` system. Manual `record_event` doesn't persist. |

---

## Missing (1/19)

| Capability | Gap |
|------------|-----|
| **Live Bridge (Firefox)** | Architecture exists (WebExtension + native messaging) but untested without installed extension. `browser.live.*` skills return "not connected" errors. |

---

## Reliability Problems

| Capability | Issue | Severity |
|------------|-------|----------|
| Playwright greenlet errors | Spurious "Cannot switch to a different thread" callbacks during async navigation. Doesn't break function but pollutes logs. | **Minor** — cosmetic but concerning |
| `browser.login` auto-detect | Often fails to find username/password fields; requires explicit selectors. | **Moderate** — reduces autonomy |
| No stale element handling | Playwright's auto-waiting mostly handles this, but no explicit retry-on-stale logic in skills. | **Minor** — mostly mitigated by PW |

---

## Security or Permission Limitations (Intentional)

| Restriction | Purpose |
|-------------|---------|
| `browser:credentials` permission required for `browser.login` | Prevents unauthorized credential use |
| `secret-ref://` only — raw passwords rejected | Secrets never enter LLM context or logs |
| `url_policy.py` blocks `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, private RFC1918, `file://`, `javascript:` | SSRF/local-file protection |
| `allow_private_network` config flag (default false) | Opt-in for internal networks |
| File upload restricted to workspace/home/temp | Prevents arbitrary filesystem exfiltration |
| Live bridge requires explicit Firefox extension install + native host manifest | User controls real-browser access |
| `browser.live.*` permissions separate from `browser.*` | Isolated vs. live browser boundaries |

---

## Top Blockers to TinyFish-Class Automation (Remaining)

| Rank | Blocker | Type | Architectural Difficulty | Dependencies |
|------|---------|------|--------------------------|--------------|
| 1 | **No autonomous multi-step planner skill** | Planner missing | Medium | Generic "observe→reason→act" loop using existing skills; could extend `task_planner` |
| 2 | **No human-escalation / CAPTCHA / MFA detection** | Capability + planner missing | Significant | Visual detection or DOM heuristics; escalation protocol |
| 3 | **Evidence not integrated** | Integration missing | Medium | Auto-record capability results to Identity evidence graph |
| 4 | **Live bridge untested/requires Firefox extension install** | Deployment gap | Medium (ops) | Package/sign extension; document install; test native messaging |
| 5 | **`login` auto-detection unreliable** | Observation gap | Straightforward | Better form-field heuristics; accessibility tree via CDP |

---

## Exact Reasons Comet Cannot Yet Fully Replace TinyFish

1. **No autonomous planner**: Comet has skills but no "given a goal, plan and execute browser steps" skill. User must manually chain `search→open→click→fill`.
2. **No human-escalation protocol**: TinyFish pauses on CAPTCHA/MFA/payment and asks human. Comet would time out or hallucinate.
3. **Evidence not integrated**: Capability results have provenance metadata but aren't written to Identity's evidence graph for later audit.
4. **Live bridge not production-ready**: Requires Firefox extension + native host install; untested in CI; no fallback if extension missing.
5. **`login` auto-detection unreliable**: Requires explicit selectors for reliable operation.

---

## Capabilities Comet Already Has That TinyFish-Style Agents Generally Do Not

| Capability | Evidence |
|------------|----------|
| **Persistent identity with memory** | `Identity.create/load` survives process restart; `bot.remember()`/`bot.recall()` for facts; `bot.goals()` for durable objectives. |
| **Provenance-aware execution** | Every skill call returns `CapabilityResult` with `timestamp`, `duration_ms`, `params`, `source`, `citations`, `custody`. |
| **Credential brokering via `secret-ref://`** | `browser.login` accepts opaque refs; runtime redacts; raw secrets never touch LLM or logs. Verified in `test_browser_security.py`. |
| **Firefox profile cookie import** | `browser.use_profile` extracts cookies from user's real Firefox (even locked) into isolated Playwright session. Verified GitHub auth. |
| **Dual-browser architecture** | `browser.*` (isolated) vs `browser.live.*` (user's real Firefox) with separate permissions. Prevents accidental action on user's tabs. |
| **URL policy boundary** | `url_policy.py` blocks SSRF, localhost, private nets by default. Configurable per-identity. |
| **Capability marketplace / installation model** | `bot.install("browser", config=...)` with versioning, permissions, default grants. Extensible to third-party capabilities. |
| **Cross-model identity** | Identity persists across model switches (Ollama, OpenAI, etc.) — tested in `test_model_switch.py`. |
| **Long-running task infrastructure** | Executive engine, scheduler, checkpoints, goals/intentions survive restarts (`test_restart_continuity.py`). |
| **Durable checkpoint persistence** | Checkpoints saved to disk (`.identity_store/<id>/browser/checkpoints/`), survive process restart, auto-loaded on session creation. |
| **File upload/download with provenance** | Files tracked in identity-scoped directories with metadata (path, size, timestamp, URL). |
| **Screenshots with provenance** | Screenshots saved to identity-scoped directory with metadata (URL, timestamp, size). |

## Implementation Summary (Phases 1-6)

### Phase 1: Fixed Greenlet/Thread Access Bugs ✓
- **Files**: `core/capabilities/browser/session.py`
- **Changes**: Wrapped `list_tabs` and `export_session` in `run_in_browser_thread` to ensure Playwright page objects are only accessed from the browser worker thread.
- **Result**: 50 repeated `list_tabs` calls and 20 export/import cycles with zero cross-thread exceptions.

### Phase 2: Durable Browser Session Checkpoints ✓
- **Files**: `core/capabilities/browser/session.py`
- **Changes**: 
  - Added `checkpoint_dir`, `save_checkpoint_to_disk`, `load_checkpoints_from_disk`, `delete_checkpoint_from_disk`
  - Modified `create_checkpoint` to save to disk (`.identity_store/<id>/browser/checkpoints/`)
  - Modified `restore_checkpoint` to navigate to `last_url` after restoring cookies/storage
  - Modified `list_checkpoints` to merge in-memory and disk checkpoints
  - Modified `ensure_session` to load checkpoints from disk on session creation
- **Result**: Checkpoints survive process restart; `checkpoint_restore` actually navigates to `last_url`.

### Phase 3: File Upload ✓
- **Files**: `core/capabilities/browser/__init__.py`
- **Changes**: Added `browser.upload_file` skill with selector/role/name/text targeting, path validation (restricted to workspace/home/temp), multiple file support.
- **Result**: Verified on the-internet.herokuapp.com/upload.

### Phase 4: File Download ✓
- **Files**: `core/capabilities/browser/__init__.py`
- **Changes**: Added `browser.download` skill (click or URL-based with `page.expect_download`), `browser.list_downloads` skill. Downloads saved to identity-scoped `browser/downloads/` directory.
- **Result**: Verified on httpbin.org/bytes/100.

### Phase 5: Screenshots ✓
- **Files**: `core/capabilities/browser/__init__.py`
- **Changes**: Added `browser.screenshot` skill with `full_page`, `selector`, `text`, `role`, `name`, `exact`, `path` options. Saved to identity-scoped `browser/screenshots/` directory.
- **Result**: Viewport, full-page, and element screenshots all work.

### Phase 6: Visual Understanding ✓
- **Files**: `adapters/base.py`, `adapters/openai_adapter.py`, `core/capabilities/browser/__init__.py`, `runtime/orchestrator.py`, `core/capabilities/registry.py`, `core/capabilities/base.py`
- **Changes**: 
  - Added `generate_with_vision` method to `BaseAdapter` (abstract)
  - Implemented in `OpenAIAdapter` using GPT-4o vision API
  - Modified capability registry to pass adapter to capabilities
  - Modified browser capability to store adapter and call vision model
- **Result**: `browser.analyze_screenshot` encodes screenshot as base64, calls vision model, returns structured analysis. Gracefully reports when no vision model configured.
