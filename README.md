## Why IdentityOS Exists

Today every AI starts over.

Your planning happens in ChatGPT. Your coding happens in VS Code. Your research happens somewhere else. Your Discord conversations stay in Discord.

Each app has its own AI. None of them know what the others learned. None of them grow.

You tell one assistant about your goals. You tell another about a cancelled project. Neither connects the dots.

**IdentityOS changes that.**

It gives AI a persistent identity, a single self that remembers across apps, learns from every conversation, gains new capabilities, and notices things no isolated AI could.

---

## What IdentityOS Is

IdentityOS is an open-source runtime for **portable AI identities**.

An identity is a persistent digital self. It has:
- A **name and persona**: who it is
- **Memory**: facts it learns about you and the world
- **Goals**: things it's working toward
- **Timeline**: a life story of events
- **Capabilities**: skills it can use (check the weather, read files, search GitHub)
- **Relationships**: trust networks with other identities and users

Identities are **portable**. Export one to JSON, move it to another machine,
and load it with a different LLM provider while preserving persisted state.

> Not shared memory. A shared self.

---

## Core Concepts

**Identity**: A persistent AI personality. It has a name, persona, memories, goals, and capabilities. You create it once and interact with it anywhere.

**Persona**: The character or role of an identity (e.g., "mentor", "analyst", "companion"). This shapes how it responds.

**Capability**: A skill an identity can use. Capabilities are installed at
runtime—no retraining needed—and invoked through validated permission and
evidence contracts. Examples include `datetime`, `filesystem`, and `github`.

**ISP (Identity Skill Pack)**: A bundle of capabilities that work together. Install one ISP and your identity gains multiple skills at once.

**Runtime**: The server that runs identities. Handles memory, context, LLM calls, capability execution, and persistence.

**Adapter**: A connector to an LLM provider. IdentityOS supports Groq, OpenAI, Anthropic, OpenRouter, SambaNova, and any OpenAI-compatible endpoint (Ollama, LM Studio, vLLM, etc.).

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- An API key from any LLM provider (or a local model running on your machine)

### One-time Setup

```bash
# Clone
git clone https://github.com/lacebx/IdentityOS.git
cd IdentityOS

# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install IdentityOS
pip install -e .

# Configure your API key
cp .env.example .env
```

### Configure Your LLM

Edit `.env` and set at least one provider. Choose whichever works for you:

**Cloud (fast, no local setup):**
```
GROQ_API_KEY="gsk_your_key_here"    # Free: https://console.groq.com
```

**Local (free, no API key needed, runs on your machine):**
```
OPENAI_BASE_URL="http://localhost:11434/v1"   # Ollama
OPENAI_API_KEY="ollama"                       # Ollama accepts any key
```

IdentityOS works with cloud or local models through adapters. Pick what fits.

### Create Your First Identity

```bash
# Create an identity named "Gabriel"
identity create --name "Gabriel" --persona messenger --id gabe

# Chat with Gabriel
identity chat --id gabe #Note: IF you have more than 1 adapter key in .env you get to chose adapter at start of each session, identity knows everything no matter what adapter you select
```

Type a few messages. IdentityOS stores everything in `.identity_store/`.

```bash
# See what Gabriel knows about you
identity inspect --id gabe --dashboard
```

---

---

## After Setup, try These

### List Your Identities

```bash
identity list
```

### Inspect an Identity

```bash
identity inspect --id gabe
```

### Checkpoint and Roll Back

```bash
identity snapshot --id gabe --label "before-experiment"
identity rollback --id gabe --snap <snapshot_id>
```

### Launch the Web Playground

```bash
identity playground
```

Open http://localhost:8000/playground

---

## Capabilities: Give Your Identity New Skills

An identity with no capabilities is just a chatbot. Add capabilities and it becomes useful.

```bash
# Browse available capabilities
identity cap list

# Install the datetime capability (so Gabriel knows the current time)
identity cap install datetime --identity gabe

# Install filesystem capability (so Gabriel can read/write files)
identity cap install filesystem --identity gabe
```

Now chat with Gabriel again. Ask "what time is it?" or "read my notes.txt". It will use the installed capabilities automatically.

> Capabilities are installed at runtime. No code changes. No retraining.

---

## ISP Marketplace: Install Skill Packs

ISPs bundle related capabilities:

```bash
# Browse available skill packs
identity isp list

# Show details of a pack
identity isp show scribe
```

Installing an ISP gives your identity multiple capabilities at once, designed to work together.

---

## Using Local Models

IdentityOS doesn't care which LLM you use. Any OpenAI-compatible API works.

**Ollama:**
```bash
# In one terminal, start Ollama
ollama pull llama3.2
ollama serve
```

```bash
# In another terminal, configure IdentityOS
export OPENAI_BASE_URL="http://localhost:11434/v1"
export OPENAI_API_KEY="ollama"  # Ollama accepts any value

identity create --name "LocalBot" --persona helpful
identity chat --id localbot
```

**LM Studio:**
```bash
export OPENAI_BASE_URL="http://localhost:1234/v1"
export OPENAI_API_KEY="not-needed"
```

**vLLM / llama.cpp / text-gen-webui:**
```bash
export OPENAI_BASE_URL="http://localhost:8000/v1"
export OPENAI_API_KEY="not-needed"
```

**HuggingFace Inference Endpoints:**
```bash
export OPENAI_BASE_URL="https://api-inference.huggingface.co/models/your-model"
export OPENAI_API_KEY="hf_your_key"
```

---

## Using Cloud Providers

Set the corresponding environment variable in `.env`:

| Provider | Env Variable | Default Model |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
| Groq | `GROQ_API_KEY` | `llama-3.3-70b-versatile` |
| OpenAI | `OPENAI_API_KEY` | `gpt-4o` |
| Anthropic | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | `claude-3-opus-20240229` |
| OpenRouter | `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | `openai/gpt-4o` |
| SambaNova | `SAMBANOVA_API_KEY` | `DeepSeek-V3.1` |

Set a custom model: `IDENTITY_MODEL="gpt-4o-mini"` in `.env`

---

## SDK Quickstart

```python
from identityos import Identity

# Create an identity
agent = Identity.create("MyBot")

# Teach it facts
agent.observe("My name is Alice and I love Python")

# Give it a goal
agent.goal("Master FastAPI", priority="high")

# Export , save to a file, share with anyone
agent.export("mybot.json")

# Restore later
restored = Identity.from_file("mybot.json")
```

No API key needed for identity features, facts, goals, memory, export. Add an adapter for chat.

## Architecture (Briefly)

IdentityOS organizes identity state into **governed modules**, each with a constitutional foundation:

| Module | What It Does |
|--------|-------------|
| **Identity** | Core properties (name, id, values) |
| **Memory** | Episodic and semantic memory with importance scoring |
| **Goals** | Long-term objectives with lifecycle management |
| **Timeline** | Append-only identity life story |
| **Capabilities** | Installable skills (runtime, no retraining) |
| **Facts** | Evidence-backed belief system |
